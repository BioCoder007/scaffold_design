### installation requirements for backbone and sequence design:

* Rosetta licence

* Psipred, if you would like to use secondary structure predictions during design and for rescoring (we recommend). 

* for faulty fragments as a filter you will need filtered 4mers (under files)

* for pair motifs, you will need the pair motif database (under files)

* Anaconda2 (or select skilearn package, see header of prediction code)
