## scaffold_design

more information, data and examples will be placed here upon peer-reviewed publication of our manuscript:

"Sampling of Structure and Sequence Space of Small Protein Folds"



### installation requirements for backbone and sequence design:

* Rosetta licence

* Psipred, if you would like to use secondary structure predictions during design and for rescoring (we recommend). 

* for faulty fragments as a filter you will need filtered 4mers (under input)

* for pair motifs, you will need the pair motif database (under input)

* Anaconda2 (or select skilearn package, see header of prediction code)
